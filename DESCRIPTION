Description: Numerically stable computation of the log of a sum of very small values, using SIMD instructions. With AVX instructions, this can be an order of magnitude faster than serial implementations (e.g. matrixStats::logSumExp). The code makes use of the C++ vector class library from Agner Fog (http://www.agner.org/optimize/#vectorclass).
